# YouTube-Data-Harvesting-And-Warehousing
YouTube Data harvesting and warehousing using Python,Pandas,MYSQL and Streamlit.

The "YouTube Data Harvesting and Warehousing" project is a comprehensive endeavor that integrates Python programming, YouTube API, MySQL database, pandas, and Streamlit to collect, store, analyze, and present data from YouTube. By leveraging these technologies, the project aims to extract valuable insights from YouTube's vast repository of videos, comments, and metadata in an efficient and user-friendly manner.

Key Components:

1.Python Programming: Python serves as the primary programming language for this project. It is utilized for tasks such as web scraping, data manipulation, analysis, and integration with MySQL database.

2.YouTube API: The YouTube API enables access to YouTube's data, including video details, comments, likes, dislikes, view counts, and other metadata. This API is essential for retrieving information from YouTube programmatically.

3.MySQL Database: MySQL is utilized as the backend database management system for storing the harvested YouTube data. A well-designed schema organizes the data efficiently for easy retrieval and analysis.

4.Pandas: The pandas library is employed for data manipulation and analysis. It facilitates tasks such as cleaning, filtering, and transforming data before storing it in the MySQL database.

5.Streamlit: Streamlit is utilized to develop an interactive web application for presenting the harvested YouTube data. Through Streamlit, users can visualize insights, perform queries, and explore the dataset intuitively via a web interface.

Project Workflow:

1.Data Collection: Web scraping techniques are used to gather data from YouTube, including video details, comments, and related metadata. Robust error handling and rate limiting are implemented to ensure compliance with YouTube's terms of service.

2.Data Storage: A MySQL database schema is designed to store the harvested YouTube data efficiently. Functions are developed to insert, update, and query data from the MySQL database.

3.Data Warehousing: The collected data undergoes cleaning and preprocessing to ensure consistency and reliability. Data transformation techniques are applied to optimize the dataset for analysis and reporting purposes.

4.User Interface Development: Streamlit is employed to create a user-friendly web-based interface for accessing and interacting with the YouTube data. Intuitive visualizations and controls are designed to facilitate data exploration and analysis.

5.Development and Testing: The application is deployed on a suitable web server or cloud platform, followed by comprehensive testing to ensure functionality, performance, and security.
